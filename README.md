# 5eAPI Alexa skill

This is a test skill for Alexa using our 5eAPI.  The goal is to turn any Alexa
into a voice activated PHB that can be used for reference during any session if
required.

Like the API itself, this is under construction and will not be released to the
public anytime in the near future.  Any questions or comments can be sent via
email at bri.reynolds@gmail.com or on twitter at @breynolds-dev.
